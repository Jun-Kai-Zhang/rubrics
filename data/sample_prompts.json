    "prompt": "write the first chapter of a story: the DNC was a complete mess and probably meddled with, the republican incumbent seems unbeatable and a frustratingly a weak candidate got the nomination, a 4 foot 10 freaky little guy.

The democratic establishment has to pivot to fully supporting the freaky little guy as he now wields great power within the party."
